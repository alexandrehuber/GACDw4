##Description
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The present summary data was assembled by Alexandre Huber as an exercise for Johns Hopkins' Data analyst specialization course on coursera.org.

##Files

- Original data files as described in README.txt
- 'README.md': present file.
- 'CodeBook.md': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'HumanActivityRecognition.txt': Means and standard deviations of all measurements associated with subject number, data subset (train / test) and activity.
- 'HumanActivityRecognitionSummary.txt': Data summary by subject number, data subset and activity. The means were calculated for each of these groups from for all measurements in 'HumanActivityRecongition.csv". 
- "run_analysis.R": R script file loading the raw data to compute the 3 preceding files.
